First project for The Odin Project. 

Task:
Replicate the Google home page. 

Learning outcomes:
Use HTML and CSS to effectively clone Google. Should be comfortable with using both
technologies by the end of the assignment.

Self reflection:
Need to be more aware of what my ID's and Classes are. Case sensitivity is
very important. Ran into a roadblock for ages because I'd named a class
LBottom in CSS but it Lbottom in HTML. 

Need to stop overthinking things. Took me a very long time to get the logo
and search bar centered. Trid using flexbox then grid then flexbox again.

Jumped around styling too much. I would style one part and then jump to
another part. Try to work methodically from top to bottom or at least in
an order of some description.
